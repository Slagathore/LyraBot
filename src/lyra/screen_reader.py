"""
Screen Reader module for Lyra

This module provides capabilities to read and understand what's on the screen,
enabling Lyra to be aware of what the user is doing and provide context-aware assistance.

Note: This is a simplified implementation and can be expanded with more advanced
computer vision and OCR capabilities in the future.
